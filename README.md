Analyzing the Impact of Password Protection on Attacker File System Traversal
For more detailed information, please refer to the final report in this repository. The report contains comprehensive explanations, methodology, and analysis.

Overview
This repository contains all the scripts, configurations, and supporting files for a research project investigating how varying levels of password protection affect the depth and frequency of attacker traversal within a simulated file system. The experiment was conducted using LXC containers, Bash scripting, a JavaScript-based Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) server, and tools like Python, Google Drive, and Google Colab for data handling and analysis.

Research Question
How does the presence and strength of password protection on files influence the depth and frequency of attacker traversal through a simulated file system?

Technology Stack
LXC (Linux Containers): To create isolated environments for attacker interactions.
Bash: For automation of container management, file system setup, log handling, and recycling processes.
JavaScript (Node.js): Used to build the MITM server for logging and tracking attacker activity.
Python: For data cleaning and statistical analysis in Google Colab.
Google Drive: For manual uploads of compressed log archives for storage and further analysis.
Google Colab: For collaborative data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
security.org Password Strength Tool: For pre-generating and validating passwords for weak, medium, and strong configurations.
Experimental Design
The experiment was conducted across five external IPs, each managed by a background recycling script. Key aspects of the experimental design include:

Random Configuration Selection:

One of four configurations was selected using a random number generator:
No Password
Weak Password
Medium Password
Strong Password
Passwords were pre-generated and validated using the security.org password strength tool.
Simulated File System:

Each container included the default Ubuntu file system.
A multi-level directory structure was added, containing fake sensitive financial data.
A poisoned cd command restricted directory access based on the assigned password for the chosen configuration.
MITM Server:

Built using JavaScript (Node.js) and managed via pm2.
Captured:
Connection and disconnection times.
Commands executed and keystrokes.
Failed connection attempts, including IPs, timestamps, and password guesses.
Dynamic Traffic Control:

The MITM server log file was monitored in real-time.
Upon detecting an attacker connection, the connecting IP was identified and dynamically allowed access while all others were blocked.
Container Recycling:

Each container was destroyed after the attacker disconnected or after a five-minute timeout.
A pre-initialized container was immediately deployed to ensure zero downtime.
Data Collection
Logs were generated by the MITM server and stored in real-time on the host system. The data collected included:

Connection Details:
Time of connection and IP address of the attacker.
Time of disconnection.
Interaction Logs:
Commands executed and keystrokes entered during the session.
Unsuccessful Access Attempts:
IPs, timestamps, and guessed passwords from failed connection attempts.
Logs were named based on the external IP and security configuration (e.g., 192.168.1.1_weakpassword.log). Every 1,000 logs were compressed into archives using a Bash script and manually uploaded to Google Drive for secure storage and analysis.
